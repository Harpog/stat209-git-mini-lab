##Cyrptocurrency visualization

(This graph is outdated but I thought it would be acceptable for the assignment.)

![](altcoin_prices_combined.png)

This visualization shows the prices of different cryptocurrencies over time. This graph was found [here](https://blog.patricktriest.com/analyzing-cryptocurrencies-python/).

Value in USD (per unit of currency) is mapped on the y axis, time is mapped on the x axis and each cryptocurrency coresponds to a color. 

These mappings make it easy to compare the progress of different currencies as they are all mapped on the same visual field and have distinct colors.

1) The visulalization is easy to understand and read.
2) I might consider adding an interactive time scale so that smaller fluctuations in value could be observed, however the visualization acomplishes its purpose.
